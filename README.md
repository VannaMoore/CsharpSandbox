# CSharpSandbox

A collection of small C# console projects used to practice fundamentals, experiment with concepts, and stay sharp through regular coding.

## Current Projects

### ConsoleSkillLab
A menu-driven console application focused on practicing core C# concepts, including:
- Control flow (`if`, `switch`, loops)
- Methods and class organization
- Namespaces and access modifiers
- Basic input validation
- Simple console-based exercises

This project is intentionally kept simple and iterative as a practice exercise.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a personal sandbox for:
- Reinforcing C# fundamentals
- Trying ideas without over-engineering
- Tracking learning progress over time

Projects may be refactored, expanded, or replaced as skills improve.

## Notes
- These projects are not production-ready by design.
- Emphasis is on clarity, structure, and learning and honing skills rather than completeness.
